					<h2> Current Annual Projects </h2> 
					<h3>Julia Robinson Math and Computing Festival</h3>
						<p class = "projectDescription"> The Julia Robinson Mathematics and Computing Festival was founded in spring 2007 to encourage middle school girls to investigate diverse areas of mathematics they would not ordinarily 
						encounter in the classroom. Mathematicians ranging from college undergraduates to first-rate professionals host tables devoted to different activities; 
						students work on the activities with each other and with the activity leader. Students spend perhaps 30 minutes on each of 6 activities that they choose from the several dozen available.  
						Advisors are asked to click here to measure student interest in the activities conducted during JRMF. </p>

				<h3>SPARCS Saturday Academy</h3>
					<p class = "projectDescription"> The SPARCS - Saturday Academy team develops and teaches training modules for pre-college students covering various computer science topics including web 
					development, security, object-oriented programming, and video game design. We serve as mentors for middle school age girls with a goal to broaden participation in STEM education (
					Science, Technology, Engineering, Math). The training sessions are conducted monthly on the UNCC campus.</p>
				<h3>High School Game Development</h3>
					<p> The High School Game Development at Olympic Outreach Group uses game development as a means of imparting the value of STEM and higher education STEM learning in an approachable and interesting
					way. We do this by interacting with the students on a weekly basis with the goal of having them create their own games and answering any questions they may have about pursuing STEM in the 
					future and about university life. Our main tool is GameMaker as it allows us to develop retro style games through an easy to learn interface that promotes the learning of computer science 
					concepts without the technical barrier of entry.  </p>
